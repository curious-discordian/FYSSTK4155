### ------------------ Phase analysis : --------------------------------- 
## By basic Fourier, we should be able to discern the probability that
## We are dealing with a stable/ordered phase.
##
## Please note that the probabilities are not calibrated here, but
## we can think of this as a pseudo-probability.
##
## It seems good enough for the measure of whether something is stable
## or not.
