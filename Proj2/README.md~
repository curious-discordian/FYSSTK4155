## Project description .
# "Actual" goal of project: 
study regression and classification continuing from project 1. 

The goal is to determine the coupling constant in an Ising model. 
This should theoretically be done by backpropogating, somewhat like linear regression. 

# Twist: 
For the novelty twist we will be pulling back to the previous work and setting up the 
problem of the neural network differently. 

We will also bring in inspiration from thermodynaic statistical physics, namely the entropy functions, like Gibbs, etc.
