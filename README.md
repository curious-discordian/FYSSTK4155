## Quick readme: 

Had to reset the repo, and it is still not going to be of help for people looking 
for a canonical way of solving things. 

As such it will mostly contain "different" ways of solving problems that 
relate to the subject. 

# On what you'll find: 
The concept is simple; if the code has to be too complicated, then 
it is not complex enough to generate sort the complicated bits on it's own, 
or you're making something that will be hard to follow. 

I try to stay within what I consider to be logical, and preferably minimal. 

That being said; I'm not very dogmatic about the pythonic way, so please 
bear with me on the lack of "standards", etc. I'll make use of functional 
elements where they make sense to me, even if that sacrifices some of the 
speedups of doing it the "pythonic" way. 

# On the mathematics; 

If I find there is mathematical foundation for something, 
I'll rather try to keep the programming true to that theory where I can.
